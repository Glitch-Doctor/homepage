# homepage
The homepage for Glitch_Doctor and his streaming community

This site will have an interactive homepage of recent highlights and any live polls.

The idea is to create a place for subcribers of my stream to have a place to voice opinions and vote on game content 
while the stream is live.

Some ad revenue will be included on the site and of course sponsorship might be included there too.

Key points to remember -
 1. Logo font is unlicensed whilst site is in development but license will be required prior to going live.
